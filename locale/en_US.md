Is this punishment?

Is it my ordeal?

Won't the vigil I've been holding for years ever end?

I'm like a little snowflake

Melting back in your palm, come back baby

---

If I see your tears

My wings melt

I can't fly to you in your dreams

Eternity started with you

In my little world

Remember when you're gone I'm halfway done

---

I'm in the deserts, I'm burning

I'm at the pole, I'm cold

I'm taking the punishment, please come back

I'm reaching out, I can't hold

I miss you, I'm crying

I don't understand are you banned, please come back

---

Even though you don't like me, I miss your voice

Even if I say go, you don't go

Is this longing or suffering that I have suffered for years?

Are you haram for me if I knew

---

Even though you don't like me, I miss your voice

Even if I say go, you don't go

Is this longing or suffering that I have suffered for years?

Are you haram for me if I knew

My baby, my ghost lover

My baby, my ghost lover

I'm in the deserts, I'm burning

I miss you, I'm crying

I don't understand are you banned, please come back
